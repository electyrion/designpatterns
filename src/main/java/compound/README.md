## Compound

The compound design pattern is a way to organize and structure different parts of a system or program so that they `work together in a coordinated and efficient way`. It is similar to how different components of a machine work together to perform a specific task.

In a compound design pattern, `different` smaller patterns or structures are `combined together` to create a more `complex and sophisticated` overall pattern. Each of these smaller patterns or structures is `designed to perform a specific function`, and when combined together, they can `achieve a more complex and powerful goal`.

An example of a compound design pattern might be a system for managing a large library of books. This system might include smaller patterns or structures for managing individual books, for searching and categorizing books, and for tracking loans and returns. By combining these smaller patterns or structures together, the overall system can provide a `robust and efficient` solution for `managing a complex` library.

In summary, the compound design pattern is a way to `combine smaller patterns` or structures to create a more complex and efficient overall solution to a problem.

The compound pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

## Design Principle

- Principle of least knowledge (LoD) states that a software entity should interact with as few other entities as possible. (Talk only to your immediate friends) [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_knowledge)

## Aplication of Compound Pattern
