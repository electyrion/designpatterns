## Adapter

- Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

## Class based approach vs Object based approach

- Class based approach: Adapter class implements the interface of the target class and has a reference to the adaptee class.
- Object based approach: Adapter class has a reference to the target class and the adaptee class.
