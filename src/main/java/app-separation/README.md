# Key Differences

## Presenter

Act as an EventListener what happens in View while also communicate with Model.

## ViewModel

Act as a mediator to expose state and data stored inside Model (specifically DataModel) to View.

## Controller

Can process the application logic, parse and display data into certain View, and commucitate with Model.

knp model gaboleh contact lgsl view? biar ga tightly coupled. low coupling juga dapat membuat proses testing dapat menjadi lebih mudah.
