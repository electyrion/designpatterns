# State Pattern

The state design pattern is a way of organizing code to help `manage different situations or states` that an object or system might be in.

Think of a traffic light at an intersection. It can be in three different states: red, yellow, or green. `Each of these states represents a different behavior` of the traffic light. When the light is red, it signals to drivers to stop. When it's yellow, it signals that the light is about to turn red and drivers should slow down. And when it's green, it signals that it's safe to go.

In software design, the state pattern helps us to `manage similar situations where an object or system can be in different states`. For example, a music player might have different states like playing, paused, or stopped. Depending on which state it's in, the music player will behave differently.

By organizing the code using the state pattern, we can make it `easier to add new states` to the object or system and to `manage the transitions between states`. It can also make the code more `modular` and easier to understand, which can help with maintenance and debugging in the long run.

## When to Use

The state design pattern is trying to solve the problem of managing different states and behaviors of an object or system in a way that is modular, flexible, and easy to maintain.

Without the state design pattern, managing different states and behaviors can be difficult and error-prone, especially as the number of states and transitions between them increases. The state design pattern provides a way to organize the code so that each state and its associated behavior is encapsulated in a separate object, making it easier to manage and modify.

The state design pattern also promotes code reusability, since each state object can be reused by multiple objects or systems that share the same state and behavior.

In addition, the state design pattern can make code more maintainable by separating the logic for each state into separate classes. This can make it easier to add new states or modify existing ones without affecting other parts of the code.

Overall, the state design pattern is trying to solve the problem of managing complexity in software design by providing a structured approach to managing different states and behaviors.
