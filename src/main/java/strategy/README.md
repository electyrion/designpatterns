# Strategy Pattern

The strategy pattern is a design pattern that helps organize code by `separating the behavior of a program from the implementation` details.

Imagine you're a coach of a sports team, and you want your team to be able to play `different strategies for different opponents`. For example, if you're playing against a very aggressive team, you might want to focus on defense and counter-attacks. But if you're playing against a weaker team, you might want to focus on scoring as many goals as possible.

In this scenario, the strategy pattern can be used to `organize the different strategies` you want your team to use. Instead of writing one big set of instructions for your team to follow, you would `write a set of instructions for each strategy`. Then, when you know which strategy you want to use, you can tell your team to follow that specific set of instructions.

This way, you can `easily switch between different strategies` without having to rewrite your entire game plan. You `simply choose` the strategy you want to use, and your team follows the instructions for that strategy.

In programming, this same pattern can be used to organize code that needs to `perform different tasks depending on the situation`. Instead of `writing one big block of code that tries to do everything at once`, you write several smaller blocks of code that each `handle a specific situation`. Then, you can choose which block of code to use based on the situation at hand.

## When to Aplly

The strategy pattern is a good choice when you have a `problem that requires different algorithms` or behaviors that can be interchangeable or switched at runtime.

In general, the strategy pattern is useful when you have a set of related algorithms or behaviors that you want to be able to use `interchangeably`, depending on the context.

For example, let's say you have a program that needs to perform `different types of sorting algorithms`, such as bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort, depending on the size and type of data being sorted. Instead of writing separate code for each algorithm, you could use the strategy pattern to create separate classes for each algorithm, and then `choose which algorithm` to use at runtime `based on the data` being sorted.

Another example could be in a `game` where different weapons or spells have different attack behaviors. You could use the strategy pattern to define a separate class for each attack behavior, and then switch between them depending on the type of enemy or situation.

In general, the strategy pattern can be useful in situations where you have a set of related behaviors or algorithms that need to be interchangeable, or when you want to `decouple a behavior or algorithm` from the rest of the code, making it easier to modify or maintain in the future.
