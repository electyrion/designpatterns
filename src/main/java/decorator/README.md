# Decorator Pattern

The decorator design pattern is a way of adding extra features or functionality to an object without changing its basic structure. It's like adding decorations to a cake to make it more visually appealing or adding toppings to a pizza to make it more flavorful.

Imagine you have a plain, simple object (like a mug). You want to add some extra functionality to it, such as making it more durable or adding a handle for easier grip. Instead of changing the basic structure of the mug, you could use a decorator to add these features as layers.

For example, you could start with a basic mug and add a layer of insulation to make it more durable. Then you could add another layer for a handle. Each layer adds a specific functionality to the mug, but it still remains a mug at its core.

In essence, the decorator design pattern allows you to modify or enhance the behavior of an object by wrapping it with one or more decorators that add new behaviors. This approach allows you to create complex objects that are highly customizable, without having to modify their underlying structure.

## When to Apply

The decorator design pattern is particularly useful when you want to add new features or behaviors to an object dynamically, without changing its original structure.

This pattern is beneficial when you have a set of objects that share common characteristics, but you want to modify each object differently. For example, you may have a basic interface or class that needs to be customized for different users or different use cases.

The decorator pattern can also be useful when you want to add new features to an object gradually or incrementally. You can add new decorators over time, without affecting the existing functionality of the object.

Another advantage of the decorator pattern is that it allows you to create complex objects by combining multiple decorators. Each decorator can add a new behavior or feature to the object, and you can stack them up in any order to achieve the desired functionality.

In summary, the decorator design pattern is useful in situations where you need to modify or enhance the behavior of an object dynamically, without changing its underlying structure, and where you want to add new features to an object gradually or incrementally.

## What is the pattern trying to solve?

The decorator design pattern is trying to solve the problem of adding new functionality to an object dynamically and without changing its original structure.

In traditional object-oriented programming, if you want to add new functionality to an object, you would have to modify the object's class or interface, which can be a problem if you don't have access to the original source code or if you don't want to make permanent changes to the object's structure.

The decorator pattern solves this problem by providing a way to wrap an object with one or more decorators, which can add new functionality to the object without changing its original structure. This approach allows you to modify an object's behavior dynamically, at runtime, by adding or removing decorators as needed.

Another problem that the decorator pattern solves is the challenge of creating complex objects with many different combinations of features. The decorator pattern allows you to stack multiple decorators on top of each other to create complex objects with custom functionality, without having to create a separate class for each combination of features.

In summary, the decorator design pattern is trying to solve the problem of adding new functionality to an object dynamically and without changing its original structure, and of creating complex objects with many different combinations of features.
