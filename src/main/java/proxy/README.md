## Proxy

Think of a bouncer outside a nightclub. The bouncer's job is to check IDs and make sure that only authorized people enter the club. However, the bouncer might not be the one actually running the club - they're just there to manage access. The bouncer is a proxy.

In software development, the proxy pattern works in a similar way. Imagine you have a piece of code that needs to access a resource, such as a file or a database. However, you want to control access to that resource and make sure that only authorized requests are allowed. A proxy provides a way to manage access to the resource without the code needing to interact directly with it.

For example, imagine you have a program that needs to access a file on a remote server. You might use a proxy to manage access to the file, ensuring that only authorized requests are allowed and providing an additional layer of security. The program would interact with the proxy, which would then interact with the file on the remote server.

So, in short, the proxy design pattern is a way of managing access to a resource without the code needing to interact directly with it. Just like a bouncer at a nightclub manages access to the club without actually running the club, a proxy in software development manages access to a resource without the code needing to interact directly with it.

- Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
