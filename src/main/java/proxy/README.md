## Proxy

Think of a bouncer outside a nightclub. The bouncer's job is to check IDs and make sure that only authorized people enter the club. However, the bouncer might not be the one actually running the club - they're just there to manage access. The bouncer is a proxy.

In software development, the proxy pattern works in a similar way. Imagine you have a piece of code that needs to access a resource, such as a file or a `database`. However, you want to control access to that resource and make sure that only authorized requests are allowed. A proxy provides a way to manage access to the resource without the code needing to interact directly with it.

For example, imagine you have a program that needs to access a file on a remote server. You might use a proxy to manage access to the file, ensuring that only authorized requests are allowed and providing an additional layer of security. The program would interact with the proxy, which would then interact with the file on the remote server.

So, in short, the proxy design pattern is a way of managing access to a resource without the code needing to interact directly with it. Just like a bouncer at a nightclub manages access to the club without actually running the club, a proxy in software development manages access to a resource without the code needing to interact directly with it.

- Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

## Another explanation

The proxy design pattern is a concept used in software development that involves using a `middleman` between two things.

Imagine you want to talk to your friend who lives in a different country, but you don't speak their language. You could hire a `translator` to help you communicate with your friend. The translator acts as a middleman between you and your friend, helping you understand each other.

Similarly, in programming, a proxy is a middleman that acts as a  `representative` for an object or service. When you use a proxy, you `don't communicate directly` with the object or service, but instead, you communicate with the proxy, which then communicates with the object or service on your behalf.

One common use case for the proxy design pattern is when you want to control access to an object or service. For example, you might want to limit who can access a database or a web service. In this case, you can use a proxy to act as a gatekeeper, `controlling access` to the object or service.

In summary, the proxy design pattern is a concept that involves using a `middleman to represent an object or service`,` often used to control access to the object or service.

## Apply the proxy design pattern

The Proxy design pattern is best used in situations where there is a need to control access to an object or resource, or when there is a need to add additional functionality to an existing object without changing its interface.

For example, consider a scenario where you have a large video file that needs to be played in a media player. Loading the entire file into memory at once could cause performance issues, so you might want to use a proxy to load and play only a portion of the file at a time. This would allow the user to start watching the video more quickly, while also reducing the amount of memory required.

In another example, you might have a sensitive object or resource that needs to be accessed only by authorized users. In this case, a proxy could be used to authenticate and authorize the user before granting access to the object or resource.

Overall, the Proxy design pattern is best used when you need to control access to an object or resource, or when you need to add additional functionality to an existing object without changing its interface.
